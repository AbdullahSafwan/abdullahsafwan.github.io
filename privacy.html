        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This privacy policy explains how Abdullah Safwan ("I", "me", or "my") collects, uses, and protects your
          information when you visit this portfolio website. I am committed to transparency about data collection
          practices and compliance with applicable privacy laws including GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Points:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I collect <strong>pseudonymous data</strong> (data that could identify you with additional information) through cookies and analytics</li>
          <li>I require your <strong>explicit consent</strong> before collecting analytics data</li>
          <li>I <strong>do not collect</strong> your name, email address, or other directly identifying information through analytics</li>
          <li>Your data is processed by <strong>third-party services</strong> including Google Analytics</li>
          <li>You have the right to <strong>withdraw consent</strong> and request data deletion at any time</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information I Collect</h2>
        <h3>Analytics Data (Pseudonymous)</h3>
        <p>
          With your consent, I use Google Analytics to collect <strong>pseudonymous data</strong> about how visitors
          interact with this website. While I cannot personally identify you by name, the following data is collected:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Client ID:</strong> A unique identifier stored in a cookie that tracks your sessions on this website</li>
          <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your IP address is sent to Google Analytics and then anonymized (last octet removed)</li>
          <li><strong>Browser fingerprint:</strong> Browser type, version, operating system, screen resolution, language, and timezone</li>
          <li><strong>Behavioral data:</strong> Pages visited, time spent on pages, buttons clicked, navigation patterns, and file downloads</li>
          <li><strong>Geographic location:</strong> Approximate location at city/region level derived from your IP address</li>
          <li><strong>Referral source:</strong> How you found this website (e.g., search engine, direct link, social media)</li>
          <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet) and manufacturer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> Under GDPR and other privacy laws, this data is considered <strong>personal data</strong>
          because it relates to an identifiable person (via the Client ID cookie and other identifiers). However, I do not
          collect your name, email address, or other directly identifying information, and I cannot personally identify
          specific individuals from my analytics dashboard.
        </p>

        <h3>Necessary Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          I use essential cookies to remember your preferences, such as your theme selection (light/dark mode) and
          cookie consent choices. These cookies are stored locally in your browser and do not track you across websites.
        </p>

        <h2>How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information collected is used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand how visitors use my portfolio</li>
          <li>Improve the website experience</li>
          <li>Track which sections are most viewed</li>
          <li>Analyze traffic patterns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          I do not sell or trade your personal information. However, the following data sharing occurs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Your data is processed by Google LLC (a third party) in accordance with
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. This includes
            transferring data to Google's servers, which may be located outside your country.</li>
          <li><strong>IP Anonymization:</strong> While IP addresses are anonymized before storage, Google initially
            receives your full IP address for geolocation purposes before removing the last octet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Google Analytics uses this data to provide me with aggregated reports and may use it to improve their own
          services. You can learn more about how Google uses data at
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accept or reject analytics cookies at any time</li>
          <li>Change your cookie preferences using the banner that appears on first visit</li>
          <li>Request information about data collected (contact me via email)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Important: Data Access and Deletion Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Please note:</strong> While Google Analytics collects pseudonymous data (Client ID, cookies, behavioral
          patterns), I do not have the ability to link this data to your real-world identity (name, email, etc.) unless
          you provide me with specific information about your visit.
        </p>

        <h4>If you request access to your data:</h4>
        <p>I can provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aggregated statistics</strong> about overall site traffic and popular pages</li>
          <li><strong>General analytics reports</strong> for specific time periods (if you provide visit dates/times and approximate location)</li>
          <li><strong>Information about what data is collected</strong> as outlined in this policy</li>
          <li><strong>Your Google Analytics Client ID</strong> (if you provide it from your browser's cookies)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I cannot provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individual session data without additional identifying information from you (I cannot link Client IDs to real people)</li>
          <li>Complete browsing history unless you provide specific session identifiers</li>
          <li>Data that directly identifies you by name (this is never collected)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>If you request deletion of your data:</h4>
        <p>
          Due to the pseudonymous nature of Google Analytics data and the lack of User-ID tracking, I cannot identify
          and delete your specific data without your Google Analytics Client ID. However, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear your browser cookies</strong> to remove the Client ID and prevent future tracking</li>
          <li><strong>Use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a></strong></li>
          <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> using the cookie preferences on this website (prevents future data collection)</li>
          <li><strong>Provide your Client ID</strong> (found in browser developer tools) for targeted deletion via Google's User Deletion API</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All analytics data is automatically deleted after Google Analytics' retention period (14-26 months by default).
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Analytics data is retained according to Google Analytics' default retention settings (typically 14-26 months).
          Cookie consent preferences are stored locally in your browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>This website uses the following third-party services that may process your data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Analytics (Google LLC):</strong> For website analytics with IP anonymization. Google may
            process your data in accordance with their privacy policy and may transfer data internationally.</li>
          <li><strong>GitHub Pages (GitHub, Inc.):</strong> For website hosting. GitHub may log IP addresses and other
            connection information for security and operational purposes.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Fonts (Google LLC):</strong> For typography. When you visit this site, Google may receive
            your IP address and browser information to serve font files.</li>
          <li><strong>Font Awesome CDN (Fonticons, Inc.):</strong> For icons. Font Awesome may receive your IP address
            when loading icon resources.</li>
          <li><strong>jsDelivr CDN:</strong> For the cookie consent library. jsDelivr may log your IP address when
            serving files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these services has their own privacy policies and data processing practices. I do not control how
          these third parties process your data beyond the configuration options I've implemented (such as IP anonymization
          for Google Analytics).
        </p>

          "Last updated" date.
